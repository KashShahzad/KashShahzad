### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kashif from Pakistan and i am a full-stack developer and programmer. I really enjoy learning languages, frameworks and libraries. I love Js for front-end and back-end development. I have experience writing mobile apps in flutter, machine learning models, Blochchain smart-contracts, Cloud storage in Firebase, AWS and Wordpress CMS. I like to write clean code using TDD, BDD, DDD, Scrum and Agile patterns of development.
